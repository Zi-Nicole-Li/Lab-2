## Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
```

```{r load-data, message=FALSE}
plastic_waste <- read.csv("data/plastic-waste.csv")
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1


```{r plastic-waste-continent}
# insert code here
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2)
plastic_waste %>%
  filter(plastic_waste_per_cap > 3.5)
```
## answer: I didn't expect this result, but after doing some research, I found Trinidad and Tobago is vulnerable to plastic pollution due to its high plastic imports and a lack of recycling infrastructure. Therefore, it's not a data error. 
## plastic waste is high in North America. 


### Exercise 2

```{r plastic-waste-density}
# insert code here
ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)
) +
  geom_density()

ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
    color = continent
  )
) +
  geom_density()

ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
    color = continent,
    fill = continent
  )
) +
  geom_density()

ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
    color = continent,
    fill = continent
  )
) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7)

```
#Ex. 2.1: Recreate the density plots above using a different (lower) alpha level that works better for displaying the density curves for all continents.
```{r}
ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)
) +
  geom_density()

ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
    color = continent
  )
) +
  geom_density()

ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
    color = continent,
    fill = continent
  )
) +
  geom_density()

ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
    color = continent,
    fill = continent
  )
) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.2)

```
## EX. 2.2: aesthetic mappings are linked to data variables, it's a dynamic way to represent data. Alpha level, is a characteristic of the geom that maintains visual consistency by controlling element transparency across the plot. in other word, Alpha level is the transparency level, which stay unchanged regardless of how data points are altered. 


### Exercise 3
#I filling the color and give my plot a name. 
```{r plastic-waste-violin}
# insert code here
ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = continent,
    y = plastic_waste_per_cap
  )
) +
 geom_boxplot(fill = "skyblue") +
  ggtitle("Box Plot: Plastic Waste per Capita by Continent")

ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = continent,
    y = plastic_waste_per_cap
  )
) +
geom_violin(fill = "lightpink", alpha = 0.2) +
  ggtitle("Violin Plot: Plastic Waste per Capita by Continent")
```

#answer for Ex. 3.1: violin plot reveal the shape and density of the data; and box plot reveal the median and it also allow for comparisons of the central tendency.

### Exercise 4

```{r plastic-waste-mismanaged}
# insert code here

ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap,
    y = plastic_waste_per_cap
  )
) +
 geom_point()

```
#answer for Ex. 4.1: A large number of data points are concentrated at lower values for both variables. And it appears to be a weak positive relationship between plastic waste per capita and mismanaged plastic waste per capita. As plastic waste per capita increases, mismanaged plastic waste per capita also tends to increase, tho this trend is not strongly linear. There is a clear outlier with a very high plastic waste per capita. 

```{r plastic-waste-mismanaged-continent}
# insert code here
ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap,
    y = plastic_waste_per_cap,
    color = continent
  )
) +
 geom_point(alpha = 0.5)

```
# answer for Ex 4.2: Africa and Asia: Tend to cluster around low values for both plastic waste per capita and mismanaged plastic waste per capita.These regions may generate less plastic waste per person but maybe struggle with waste management systems.
# Europe and North America: seems like to have higher plastic waste per capita than Africa and Asia.But mismanaged plastic waste per capita remains relatively low, indicating better waste management infrastructure.

# Oceania:Similar to Europe and North America, with low levels of mismanaged plastic waste and relatively high plastic waste per capita. South America: Shows a wide range of variation in mismanaged plastic waste per capita, with some points extending to higher values than other continents.

```{r plastic-waste-population-total}
# insert code here
ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = total_pop,
    y = plastic_waste_per_cap
  )
) +
 geom_point()

```

```{r plastic-waste-population-coastal}
# insert code here
ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = coastal_pop,
    y = plastic_waste_per_cap
  )
) +
 geom_point()

```
# answer for Ex.4.3 ⬇️

#for total_pop: The points are clustered near the lower values for total population, with only a few points spread across higher population ranges. there's no clear linear association between totap_pop and plastic waste per capita. total_pop does not seem to directly predict plastic waste per cap.

# for coastal_pop: Similar to the total_pop scatterplot, points are concentrated at lower coastal population values, with a few outliers at higher coastal population values.There does not appear to be a strong linear association here either.

# None of of these pairs of variables appear to be more strongly linearly associated than another; hard to identify any trends here.

### Exercise 5
```{r recreate-viz}
# insert code here
plastic_waste <- read.csv("data/plastic-waste.csv")

plastic_waste %>%
  filter(plastic_waste_per_cap <= 3.5)

plastic_waste$coastal_pop_proportion <- plastic_waste$coastal_pop / plastic_waste$total_pop

ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = coastal_pop,
    y = plastic_waste_per_cap,
    color = continent
  )
) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(color = "black", method = "loess", se = TRUE,) 
  

```
